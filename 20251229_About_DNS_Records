About DNS Records
DNS (Domain Name System) records are instructions that provide information about a domain, including its IP addresses, mail servers, and other services. 
Common record types include:

SOA (Start of Authority) - Contains administrative information about the zone
NS (Nameserver) - Specifies authoritative nameservers for the domain
A (Address) - Maps a domain to an IPv4 address
AAAA - Maps a domain to an IPv6 address
CNAME (Canonical Name) - Creates an alias pointing to another domain
MX (Mail Exchange) - Specifies mail servers for the domain
